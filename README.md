# DELVE - Social Media & Itiernary generator Application

> **Abstract** : Travelling is one of the greatest experiences which makes the human learn many skills, experience emotions of others in the life. In this project we have proposed a system which helps the tourist to travel easily by giving the experience of our MERN-based travel website DELVE. The system consists of features like posting pictures on which other users can give a like and comment on it. 
The key feature of our system is recommending the Itinerary of the tourist places to visit at a low cost and in less time. Another one is that the system provides the best deal to the user to travel to their favorite places. And the most important is a review of the tourist places which makes the system more efficient to recommend the user to travel.
